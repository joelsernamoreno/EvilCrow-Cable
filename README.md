# Data line information
Before using the data line in Evil Crow cable, read the following information:

The data line has been enabled with the published basic schema. Controlling the data line in Evil Crow cable is difficult because it does not have a USB hub inside.

When you connect a multimedia device (e.g. smartphone, mp3, etc.) to Evil Crow cable, the data line is in front of the Attiny85 microcontroller. This blocks the execution of the payload while the multimedia device is connected.

You can understand this with the following basic image. Anyway, in the section "Attack options", you can see the payload execution situations with/without the data line:

![Data Line](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Cable/blob/master/images/dataline.PNG)

# Attack options

The following attack scenarios show the correct use of payload and data line execution:

1. **Evil Crow cable is connected to a PC:** the payload is executed.
2. **Evil Crow cable and a multimedia device are connected at the same time to a PC:** The data line is enabled and you can see the Mass Storage of the multimedia device, but the payload does not run.
3. **Evil Crow cable is connected to a PC and after running the payload, you connect a multimedia device:** The data line is enabled, but you have to wait 10-15 seconds before connecting the multimedia device. If you connect before 10-15 seconds the multimedia device, you may have errors.
4. **First Evil Crow cable and a multimedia device connect to a PC at the same time (Mass Storage enabled), then disconnect the multimedia device:** the payload is executed.

**Demo video:** https://twitter.com/JoelSernaMoreno/status/1189658626929111040?s=19

**Note:** You can consider the data line as proof of concept (PoC). In future versions the data line may be more advanced.
